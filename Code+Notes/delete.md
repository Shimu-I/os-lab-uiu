## 📂 Directory Example:

```bash
drwxr-xr-x  2 tashin tashin 4096 Aug  2 18:00 project
```

* `d` → directory
* `rwx` → owner can read, write, execute
* `r-x` → group can read and execute
* `r-x` → others can read and execute

---

## 🎓 Tips for Viva:

### 🔹 Q: What does `ls -l` do?

> Shows a long listing format of files and directories, including permissions, size, owner, and modification time.

### 🔹 Q: What does `drwxr-xr-x` mean?

> * `d` → directory
> * `rwx` → owner has read, write, execute
> * `r-x` → group has read, execute
> * `r-x` → others have read, execute

---

## 🛠️ Practice Task:

1. Create a file: `touch test.txt`
2. Create a folder: `mkdir demo`
3. Run `ls -l` and try to read each line

---

### ✅ Corrected version of your sentence:

> Teach me about `ls -l`.

---

Let me know if you want me to teach `chmod` next — it's how you **change permissions** shown in `ls -l`. 🔐

Awesome, Tashin! You're exploring one of the most useful navigation commands in Linux.

---

## 📘 What does `cd ../folder02` mean?

### ✅ Breakdown:

* `cd` → Change directory
* `..` → Go **up one level** (parent directory)
* `folder02` → Then go **into a folder named `folder02`** in that parent directory

---

### 🧠 In short:

> "Go up one level, then enter the `folder02` directory."

---

### 🗂️ Example Scenario:

Suppose you are currently in this path:

```
/home/tashin/project/folder01/
```

And the structure looks like this:

```
/home/tashin/project/
├── folder01/
├── folder02/
```

Then if you run:

```bash
cd ../folder02
```

You will move from:

```
/home/tashin/project/folder01/
```

To:

```
/home/tashin/project/folder02/
```

### 🔧 Related Commands for Practice:

| Command          | Meaning                                  |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `cd ..`          | Go one level up                          |
| `cd ../folder02` | Go up, then into `folder02`              |
| `cd ../../`      | Go up **two levels**                     |
| `cd ~/Desktop`   | Go to the Desktop in your home directory |
| `cd`             | Go to home directory                     |

### ✅ Corrected English version of your sentence:

> What does `cd ../folder02` mean?

---

Let me know if you want a **Linux directory structure diagram** or an assignment based on relative paths. You're doing great with shell navigation! 🚀🧭








======================================


sn't exist yet, `-p` tells the system to **create it automatically** before making `Assignment-01`.

### ✅ Safe to Use:

If the folder already exists, `-p` won’t throw an error — it just silently continues.

---

## 🔹 4. Check Where You Are in Terminal

```bash
pwd
```

* `pwd` = print working directory
* It shows your current folder path, like:

```
/home/tashin/os-lab-uiu/Assignments
```

---

## 🔹 5. Create a New File

```bash
touch code.c
```

* `touch` → creates an **empty file**
* `code.c` → name of the file you want

✅ You can now open it with:

```bash
gedit code.c
# OR
code code.c   # if you're using VS Code
```

---

## 🔹 6. Move a File to Another Folder

### Let's say you created a file in the main folder, and want to move it into a subfolder:

```bash
mv code.c Assignments/Assignment-01/
```

* `mv` → move
* `code.c` → the file you want to move
* `Assignments/Assignment-01/` → destination folder

✅ After this, the file is no longer in the original place — it’s now inside `Assignment-01/`.

---

## 🧠 Visual Example

Imagine this before the move:

```
os-lab-uiu/
├── code.c
└── Assignments/
    └── Assignment-01/
```

After you do:

```bash
mv code.c Assignments/Assignment-01/
```

Now it's:

```
os-lab-uiu/
└── Assignments/
    └── Assignment-01/
        └── code.c
```
